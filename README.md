# PortalSelect

Mod for VRChat / MelonLoader 0.4.0 to open the world info page of portal.\
If portal points to specific instance, it will open that specific world instance.\
Made this mod because I wanted to visit the portal worlds later. So save the world to favorites without entering it.\
\
This mod uses [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods), so you need to have this mod installed too.\
\
I used some of [FavCat](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/blob/master/FavCat/ScanningReflectionCache.cs#L21) code to open the world page.\
As reference for getting some values from PortalInternal I used [AskToPortal](https://github.com/loukylor/VRC-Mods/blob/main/AskToPortal/AskToPortalMod.cs#L95)\
And for getting controller transform & pressed trigger I used some of [BetterPortalPlacement](https://github.com/d-mageek/VRC-Mods/blob/main/BetterPortalPlacement/Utils/Utilities.cs#L67)\
Giving big thank you to them.

# Usage:
## VR
- Open Worlds page menu
- Point at portal
- With the controller you are pointing with, press trigger
## Desktop

To open the page of another portal, click "Back" to get back to the worlds page and select another portal.
